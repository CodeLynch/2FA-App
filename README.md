### `2FA OTP APP`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and developed by John Vergil Aparri.

## `How to test this app`
Make sure that you have an application that can run a local web server like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc.
and you have Node.js installed in your computer. 

First, start Apache and Mysql in your web server application. Then, open a terminal and go to the directory where you placed 
this app and type "npm install" to install this app's packages. Then change to the directory of the server folder in this app. 
Type 'npm run devStart' to run the backend of this app. Open another terminal and go to the directory of this app, 
Type 'npm start' to run the frontend of the app.

The app should open in your browser in a few minutes and will be ready for testing!
