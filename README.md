### `2FA OTP APP`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and developed by John Vergil Aparri.

## `How to test this app`
Make sure that you have an application that can run a local web server like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc.
and Node.js installed in your computer 

After starting the server open a terminal and go to the directory where you placed this app.
Go first to the directory of the server folder in this app and call 'npm run devStart' to run the backend
of this app.
Open another terminal and go to the directory of this app and call 'npm start' to run the frontend of the app.

The app should open in your browser and ready for testing!
